## What does Setta do?

Setta is a general-purpose developer tool that streamlines Python coding, configuration, UI creation, and onboarding.

It enables you to:
- Skip the boilerplate parsers and frontend. 
- Effortlessly expose your Python functions as a flexible UI. 
- Configure, interact, and share with ease.

So whether you are fine tuning large AI models, or writing a small Python script, Setta can turn it into a useable interface. No special integrations required!

Here's a short intro video:

## Examples

Trying out Setta is the best way to see what it can do, and we have a bunch of easy-to-run examples here: https://github.com/settadev/examples

Or click on one of the images below to go directly to that example:

We also have [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/@settadev).

## Getting started

Activate your Python environment, and run:

```
pip install setta
```

Let's say you've created a new, empty git repo in a folder called `my_project`.

Move into that folder and run:

```
setta
```

The Setta UI will now be available in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

You'll also notice that Setta has created a few files. Here's what the structure of your `my_project` folder will look like: 

```
my_project/
├── setta_files/
│   ├── setta.db
│   ├── setta-settings.json
│   ├── setta-meta-settings.json
│   └── code/
│       └── temp_folder/
```

### Create and run your first Setta project

On the home page click `New Config`. This will load a brand new, empty project.

</p>

Right click to open the context menu, and click `Section` to create your first section. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Double click on the section name, and rename it to `special_val`. Type `math.sqrt` in the callable field, and press the tab key. An `x` parameter should appear in the parameters area. Enter `10` in the text field next to `x`.

</p>

Right click to open the context menu, and click `Python Code` to create a code block.

</p>

Paste the following into this code block:

```python
$SETTA_GENERATED_PYTHON

print(special_val)
```

Click Run in the nav bar. A terminal will appear and it should print 3.1622776601683795.

</p>

Congratulations! You've successfully run your first Setta project!

### What happens under the hood

When you click the Run button,  Setta replaces `$SETTA_GENERATED_PYTHON` with:

```python
import math

x = 10
special_val = math.sqrt(x)
```

Notice how it:
- Imports the Python `math` library.
- Converts your `special_val` section into a variable, equal to `math.sqrt(10)`.
